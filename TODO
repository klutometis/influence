* TODO connectionist
  since $a_j(t + 1)$ depends on $a_j(t)$, we should calculate $t + 1$
  and then update the graph atomically: we can't let the $t + 1$
  contaminate $t$.
* TODO input specification
  can we just do something like this:
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
    (a 0.5)
    (b +high)
    (b -low)
    (c evidence)
    (a b +high)
    (c b -low)
    (a c 0.5)
  #+END_SRC

  or is that an appropriate way to handle evidence? do we need
  multiple evidence? let's just have a special (pre-existing) node to
  that effect:

  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
    (a 0.5)
    (b +high)                               ; or (b high)
    (c -low)
    (a b +high)
    (evidence c -low)
    (a evidence 0.5)
  #+END_SRC

  so: we'll have nodes (activation) and links (weight, whence,
  whither); no name for now.

  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme :tangle graph.scm :shebang #!/usr/bin/env chicken-scheme
